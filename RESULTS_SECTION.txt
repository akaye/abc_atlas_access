RESULTS

3.1 Cell type composition and data modalities

We analyzed neuromodulator receptor expression in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using two complementary data modalities from the Allen Brain Cell Atlas: 10x single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and MERFISH spatial transcriptomics. The 10x dataset provided whole-transcriptome coverage (28 receptor genes analyzed) across 4,042,976 cells, while the MERFISH dataset offered spatially resolved expression with CCF-registered anatomical localization across 4,334,174 cells, albeit limited to 11 receptor genes present in the 550-gene MERFISH panel.

For the BLA, the 10x dataset yielded 28,809 neuronal cells comprising 18,938 excitatory neurons from two BLA-specific subclasses (LA-BLA-BMA-PA Glut with 16,778 cells and MEA-COA-BMA Ccdc42 Glut with 2,160 cells) and 9,871 GABAergic interneurons across 8 major subclasses (Sst Gaba 2,609 cells, Vip Gaba 2,081 cells, Pvalb Gaba 1,343 cells, Lamp5 Gaba 1,208 cells, Sncg Gaba 1,086 cells, Lamp5 Lhx6 Gaba 678 cells, Sst Chodl Gaba 448 cells, and Pvalb chandelier Gaba 418 cells). Including glia (19,140 astrocytes and 6,164 microglia from the CTXsp region), the total analyzed BLA dataset comprised 54,113 cells across 12 subclasses (Figure 1). A critical caveat is that GABAergic interneuron subclasses in the 10x data derive from the entire cortical subplate (CTXsp) dissection region and cannot be spatially localized to BLA versus neighboring structures (claustrum, endopiriform nucleus) based on transcriptomic identity alone. The MERFISH dataset addressed this limitation through CCF parcellation, yielding 8,238 cells with confirmed BLA localization (including 4,484 LA-BLA-BMA-PA Glut excitatory neurons, 1,676 interneurons across 6 subclasses, and 2,097 glia) distributed across three BLA substructures: anterior (BLAa, 5,933 cells), posterior (BLAp, 4,647 cells), and ventral (BLAv, 2,653 cells) (Figure 5, Supplementary Figure S3).

For the mPFC (prelimbic, infralimbic, and dorsal anterior cingulate areas), the 10x dataset provided 165,539 neuronal cells including 135,459 excitatory neurons across 10 layer-defined cortical subclasses (L6 CT CTX Glut 38,354 cells, L4/5 IT CTX Glut 23,357 cells, L6 IT CTX Glut 20,452 cells, L2/3 IT CTX Glut 18,401 cells, L5 IT CTX Glut 15,020 cells, L5 NP CTX Glut 7,529 cells, L5 ET CTX Glut 5,710 cells, L6b CTX Glut 3,295 cells, L2/3 IT RSP Glut 2,666 cells, and L4 RSP-ACA Glut 675 cells) and 30,080 GABAergic interneurons across 8 subclasses, resolving into 101 finer supertypes (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S2). With glia (14,917 astrocytes and 6,823 microglia), the total mPFC 10x dataset comprised 187,279 cells across 20 subclasses. The MERFISH dataset provided 64,474 region-specific cells distributed across four cortical areas: anterior cingulate dorsal (ACAd, 25,482 cells), anterior cingulate ventral (ACAv, 27,707 cells), prelimbic (PL, 18,243 cells), and infralimbic (ILA, 7,084 cells) (Figure 6, Supplementary Figure S4).

The MERFISH gene panel captured 5 of 14 serotonin receptors (Htr1b, Htr1d, Htr2a, Htr3a, Htr7; missing Htr1a, Htr1f, Htr2b, Htr2c, Htr3b, Htr4, Htr5a, Htr5b, Htr6), 2 of 9 noradrenergic receptors (Adra1a, Adra1b; missing Adra1d, Adra2a/b/c, Adrb1/2/3), and 4 of 5 dopamine receptors (Drd1, Drd2, Drd3, Drd5; missing Drd4), limiting cross-modality comparisons to these 11 genes but enabling spatially resolved validation of the most critical targets identified in the 10x data.


3.2 Serotonin receptor expression patterns

Htr2a, the primary target of classic psychedelics including psilocybin and LSD, exhibited robust and highly cell-type-specific expression patterns that were remarkably consistent across brain regions and data modalities. In the BLA, 10x data revealed highest Htr2a expression in parvalbumin-positive interneurons (Pvalb Gaba: mean log2 expression 5.17, fraction expressing 75.9%) and Lamp5 interneurons (5.07, 74.0%), with moderate expression in excitatory neurons (LA-BLA-BMA-PA Glut: 0.91, 15.8%) (Figure 1). MERFISH spatial data confirmed this pattern with strong Htr2a signal in Pvalb (2.33, 94.4%) and Lamp5 (2.13, 92.0%) interneurons spatially localized within BLA substructures (Supplementary Figure S3). In the mPFC, Htr2a expression was prominent across multiple cortical layers, particularly in deep-layer intratelencephalic neurons (L4/5 IT CTX Glut: 4.68, 69.8%; L5 IT CTX Glut: 4.61, 67.6%; L6 IT CTX Glut: 4.55, 67.6%) and parvalbumin interneurons (4.00, 60.5%) (Figure 2). Notably, the superficial layer neurons that send cortico-amygdalar projections showed moderate expression (L2/3 IT CTX Glut: 2.68, 43.6%). Cross-modality validation demonstrated strong agreement between 10x and MERFISH platforms, with Spearman correlation coefficients of ρ=0.964 for BLA and ρ=0.953 for mPFC when comparing cell-type-specific expression profiles (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S5). Cross-region comparison revealed largely conserved Htr2a expression patterns across shared interneuron types (MERFISH cross-region ρ=0.929), with modest enrichment in BLA Pvalb interneurons relative to mPFC (Figure 4).

Htr1a, the high-affinity 5-HT1A autoreceptor and heteroreceptor implicated in modulating psychedelic responses and anxiolytic drug action, was absent from the MERFISH panel but showed distinctive expression patterns in the 10x data. The highest Htr1a expression was observed in somatostatin-positive interneurons, particularly the Sst Chodl subclass (BLA: 4.50, 70.3%; mPFC: 3.46, 53.6%) and parvalbumin chandelier cells (BLA: 1.59, 28.7%; mPFC: 1.34, 22.3%), with broader moderate expression across cortical Sst interneurons (BLA: 1.54, 26.6%; mPFC: 1.24, 20.8%) (Figures 1–2). In mPFC, Htr1a also showed notable expression in superficial and middle-layer excitatory neurons (L4/5 IT: 1.28, 23.7%; L5 IT: 1.17, 21.5%). This distribution positions Htr1a-expressing interneurons to modulate circuit gain and potentially shape psychedelic-induced cortical dynamics through GABAergic inhibition.

Htr2c, which opposes Htr2a signaling in anxiety circuits and is targeted by the FDA-approved anti-obesity drug lorcaserin, exhibited strikingly high and cell-type-selective expression that was also absent from the MERFISH panel. The most dramatic Htr2c enrichment occurred in Sncg interneurons (BLA: 8.74, 93.2%; mPFC: 7.04, 84.1%), a neurogliaform-like population of CGE-derived interneurons known for dense local inhibition (Figures 1–2). L5 near-projecting neurons (L5 NP CTX Glut) in mPFC showed exceptionally high expression (8.15, 88.9%), as did retrosplenial-projecting L2/3 and L4 neurons in anterior cingulate regions (L2/3 IT RSP Glut: 7.05, 81.4%; L4 RSP-ACA Glut: 6.95, 91.7%). BLA excitatory neurons displayed strong expression (LA-BLA-BMA-PA Glut: 6.45, 80.8%; MEA-COA-BMA Ccdc42 Glut: 8.20, 92.3%), with substantial expression also in Vip (BLA: 6.87, 76.9%; mPFC: 4.59, 56.2%) and Pvalb interneurons (BLA: 5.95, 74.1%). Cross-region analysis revealed significant BLA enrichment for Htr2c (mean log2 fold-change +1.604), making it the most region-differentiated serotonin receptor (Figure 4, Supplementary Figure S7).

Htr7, a Gs-coupled receptor implicated in fear extinction and circadian regulation, showed highest expression in deep-layer corticothalamic and cortico-tectal projection neurons (mPFC: L6 CT CTX Glut 7.60, 93.5%; L6b CTX Glut 6.24, 80.2%; L5 ET CTX Glut 6.35, 87.1%) and parvalbumin chandelier cells (BLA: 7.66, 93.8%; mPFC: 7.80, 93.3%) in the 10x data (Figures 1–2). Moderate expression was also observed in Sst Chodl interneurons and L5 NP neurons (5.46, 72.5%). MERFISH data confirmed Htr7 expression in Sst interneurons and projection neuron populations, with Spearman correlations of ρ=0.745 (BLA) and ρ=0.816 (mPFC) between modalities (Figure 3). Notably, Htr7 showed significant BLA enrichment across shared cell types (10x cross-region log2 FC +0.681, MERFISH +0.693), suggesting potential region-specific contributions to amygdala-dependent fear extinction (Figure 4).

Htr3a, a marker of CGE-derived interneurons and the only ionotropic serotonin receptor, showed highly selective expression in Sncg (BLA 10x: 6.44, 81.0%; mPFC 10x: 6.14, 76.8%; BLA MERFISH: 2.87, 76.4%; mPFC MERFISH: 3.71, 86.9%) and Vip interneurons (BLA 10x: 4.17, 56.5%; mPFC 10x: 2.84, 37.7%; BLA MERFISH: 2.47, 86.4%; mPFC MERFISH: 2.36, 82.2%) across all datasets (Figures 1–2, Supplementary Figures S3–S4). This pattern was among the most reproducible across modalities (BLA ρ=0.685, mPFC ρ=0.890) and regions (MERFISH ρ=0.714), consistent with Htr3a's established role as a canonical CGE interneuron marker. The rapid ionotropic depolarization mediated by Htr3a receptors in these disinhibitory interneuron populations may contribute to serotonergic modulation of cortical gain and oscillatory dynamics.

Additional serotonin receptors showed more restricted or lower expression. Htr1b was moderately expressed in excitatory neurons (BLA: LA-BLA-BMA-PA Glut 1.61, 28.6%; mPFC: L2/3 IT 1.56, 27.1%) with excellent cross-modality agreement (BLA ρ=0.879, mPFC ρ=0.914). Htr1d showed sparse expression overall but displayed the most variable cross-modality concordance (BLA ρ=0.285, mPFC ρ=0.571), likely reflecting its generally low transcript levels approaching technical detection limits. Htr1f, Htr2b, Htr3b, Htr4, Htr5a/b, and Htr6 (all 10x-only) showed minimal expression across most cell types, with Htr1f notable as a moderate marker of projection neurons and Htr4 enriched in L5 ET and L5 NP neurons.


3.3 Noradrenergic receptor expression patterns

The β1-adrenergic receptor (Adrb1), the primary target of the β-blocker propranolol used to treat anxiety and prevent fear memory reconsolidation, exhibited dominant expression in excitatory neurons with a strong mPFC bias. In mPFC, Adrb1 showed high expression across all cortical layers (L4/5 IT: 4.96, 76.7%; L2/3 IT: 4.64, 71.4%; L5 IT: 4.55, 70.9%; L5 ET: 4.60, 74.2%; L6 IT: 3.85, 61.6%), with lower but detectable expression in interneurons (Figure 2). BLA excitatory neurons showed more moderate Adrb1 expression (LA-BLA-BMA-PA Glut: 2.95, 52.1%), with interneurons expressing at similar or higher levels (Pvalb chandelier: 3.71, 62.2%; Vip: 3.33, 50.4%; Sst: 3.11, 53.3%) (Figure 1). Cross-region analysis confirmed significant mPFC enrichment for Adrb1 (log2 FC -0.354, reflecting mPFC > BLA), particularly in excitatory neurons, potentially underlying region-specific noradrenergic modulation of prefrontal executive function versus amygdala threat processing.

Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors Adra1a and Adra1b, Gq-coupled receptors mediating noradrenergic excitation, displayed complementary expression patterns favoring GABAergic interneurons. Adra1a showed highest expression in Lamp5 interneurons across both regions (BLA 10x: 4.37, 57.2%; BLA MERFISH: 0.99, 70.8%; mPFC MERFISH: 1.58, 82.5%) and Pvalb interneurons (BLA MERFISH: 0.81, 58.4%; mPFC MERFISH: 1.42, 81.0%), with notable enrichment in mPFC Sst Chodl (10x: 1.73, 88.2%) and Lamp5 Lhx6 populations (MERFISH: 2.14, 93.6%). Adra1b was most prominently expressed in Vip interneurons (BLA 10x: 2.18, 88.9%; mPFC 10x: 2.88, 95.8%), Lamp5 interneurons (BLA 10x: 1.41, 88.3%), and Sncg interneurons (BLA 10x: 1.51, 80.6%), with strong enrichment in mPFC relative to BLA (MERFISH log2 FC -1.215, the largest regional difference observed for any receptor). These patterns suggest that noradrenergic modulation via α1 receptors preferentially targets inhibitory microcircuits, with Adra1a favoring neurogliaform-like Lamp5 populations and Adra1b favoring disinhibitory Vip and Sncg interneurons.

Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which are Gi-coupled inhibitory receptors absent from the MERFISH panel, showed more restricted expression in the 10x data. Adra2c was moderately expressed in BLA excitatory neurons (LA-BLA-BMA-PA Glut: 3.21, 55.6%) and Sncg interneurons (2.71, 48.3%), with lower mPFC expression (L2/3 IT: 2.87, 49.8%; L5 IT: 1.59, 28.8%), resulting in significant BLA enrichment (log2 FC +0.925). Adra2a showed even stronger BLA bias (log2 FC +1.118), with preferential expression in BLA excitatory and interneuron populations. These Gi-coupled α2 receptors may mediate presynaptic autoinhibition of norepinephrine release and postsynaptic inhibition, with their BLA enrichment potentially contributing to region-specific noradrenergic modulation of threat processing. The β2 and β3 adrenergic receptors (Adrb2, Adrb3) showed minimal expression across cell types, and Adra1d expression was sparse.


3.4 Dopamine receptor expression patterns

D1-like dopamine receptors (Drd1, Drd5) showed prominent expression in deep cortical layers and select interneuron populations. Drd1 was most highly expressed in Sst Chodl interneurons (BLA 10x: 4.25, 68.1%; mPFC 10x: 4.12, 65.6%; mPFC MERFISH: 2.37, 86.8%), deep-layer projection neurons (mPFC 10x: L6b 3.86, 59.3%; L6 IT 2.95, 49.1%; L6 CT 1.75, 29.7%; MERFISH: L6b 2.50, 89.3%; L6 IT 1.90, 87.9%; L6 CT 1.46, 76.6%), and BLA excitatory neurons (MEA-COA-BMA Ccdc42 Glut 10x: 1.64, 27.2%; MERFISH: 1.16, 70.1%). Moderate Drd1 expression was also observed in Sst (BLA 10x: 1.41, 25.5%) and Pvalb interneurons (mPFC 10x: 1.63, 28.4%; MERFISH: 1.66, 83.8%). Cross-modality agreement for Drd1 was excellent (BLA ρ=0.794, mPFC ρ=0.927), supporting high confidence in this expression pattern (Figure 3). Drd5 showed a similar but more restricted pattern, with highest expression in deep-layer neurons (mPFC 10x: L6b 0.76, 13.2%; L6 CT 0.64, 11.4%; L5 NP 0.51, 8.5%; MERFISH: L6b 0.97, 58.6%; L6 CT 0.83, 56.6%; L5 NP 0.76, 54.5%). The enrichment of D1-like receptors in deep layers suggests preferential dopaminergic modulation of cortico-subcortical projection pathways originating from L5 ET, L6 CT, and L6b neurons.

D2-like receptors showed more selective expression favoring specific GABAergic populations. Drd2 was most prominently expressed in Sst interneurons (BLA 10x: 0.75, 13.5%; mPFC 10x: 0.72, 12.1%; BLA MERFISH: 0.44, 32.2%; mPFC MERFISH: 0.56, 37.6%), Sst Chodl (mPFC 10x: 0.36, 5.7%; MERFISH: 0.49, 36.8%), and Sncg interneurons (BLA 10x: 0.30, 5.4%; mPFC 10x: 0.65, 11.2%; mPFC MERFISH: 0.44, 28.9%). Modest expression was also detected in L5 ET neurons (mPFC 10x: 0.32, 6.0%). Cross-region comparison revealed significant BLA enrichment for Drd2 (10x log2 FC +0.630), suggesting enhanced dopaminergic inhibition of GABAergic microcircuits in the amygdala relative to prefrontal cortex. Drd3 showed minimal expression overall, with highest levels in Sst Chodl interneurons (BLA 10x: 0.22, 4.2%; mPFC 10x: 0.13, 2.2%). Drd4, absent from the MERFISH panel, showed sparse expression in the 10x data across all cell types.


3.5 Cross-modality validation of receptor expression patterns

To assess the robustness of cell-type-specific receptor expression patterns across measurement platforms, we systematically compared 10x snRNA-seq and MERFISH spatial transcriptomics data for the 11 shared receptor genes across matched cell types. Overall correlation between modalities was strong, with Spearman correlation coefficients for fraction of cells expressing each receptor of ρ=0.788 for BLA and ρ=0.884 for mPFC across all gene × cell type combinations (Figure 3A–B). Mean expression levels showed similar concordance (BLA ρ=0.758, mPFC ρ=0.859), though with greater variance attributable to the technical differences between nuclear (10x) versus whole-cell (MERFISH) RNA capture and the more limited dynamic range of the targeted MERFISH panel.

Per-gene analysis revealed highly consistent cross-platform agreement for most receptors, with per-cell-type expression patterns (across the 11 genes) correlating at ρ≥0.8 for the majority of genes (Supplementary Figure S5). Htr2a showed the strongest cross-modality concordance (BLA ρ=0.964, mPFC ρ=0.953), followed by Adra1b (BLA ρ=0.685, mPFC ρ=0.926), Drd1 (BLA ρ=0.794, mPFC ρ=0.927), Htr1b (BLA ρ=0.879, mPFC ρ=0.914), and Htr3a (BLA ρ=0.685, mPFC ρ=0.890). These receptors exhibited consistent cell-type rankings between platforms, providing high confidence for experimental prioritization. Htr7 showed good agreement (BLA ρ=0.745, mPFC ρ=0.816), while Adra1a displayed moderate concordance (BLA ρ=0.588, mPFC ρ=0.571). The weakest cross-platform agreement was observed for Htr1d (BLA ρ=0.285, mPFC ρ=0.571) and Drd3 (BLA ρ=0.467, mPFC ρ=0.600), likely reflecting sparse expression approaching technical noise floors in both platforms.

Per-cell-type analysis (correlating receptor profiles across the 11 genes within each cell type) demonstrated that glial populations showed the strongest cross-platform concordance (astrocytes: BLA ρ=0.982 for fraction expressing, mPFC ρ=0.991; microglia: BLA ρ=0.927, mPFC ρ=0.945), likely due to their highly distinctive expression signatures and larger cell sizes favoring MERFISH detection (Supplementary Figure S5). Among neuronal populations, mPFC excitatory neurons showed excellent agreement (L6 IT ρ=0.924, L4/5 IT ρ=0.909, L2/3 IT ρ=0.897), as did most mPFC interneurons (Vip ρ=0.964, Sncg ρ=0.903, Lamp5 ρ=0.873). BLA cell types showed somewhat lower but still substantial concordance, with BLA excitatory neurons (LA-BLA-BMA-PA Glut ρ=0.709, MEA-COA-BMA Ccdc42 Glut ρ=0.636) and interneurons (Vip ρ=0.855, Sst ρ=0.782, Pvalb ρ=0.673, Lamp5 ρ=0.636) displaying moderate to good agreement. The somewhat weaker BLA correlations likely reflect the confounding effect that BLA interneurons in the 10x dataset derive from the entire CTXsp dissection region rather than being spatially restricted to BLA as in the MERFISH data.

Consensus receptor rankings, computed by averaging cell-type ranks across both modalities and weighting by cross-platform agreement, identified 55 high-confidence gene × cell type combinations (consensus rank ≤3, confidence ≥0.7) that showed minimal rank discordance between platforms (Supplementary Figure S6). For Htr2a, high-confidence top-ranked cell types included BLA Pvalb and Lamp5 interneurons and mPFC L4/5 IT and L6 IT excitatory neurons. For Htr3a, Sncg and Vip interneurons ranked first in both regions with perfect cross-platform agreement. Drd1 showed consistent top rankings in deep-layer neurons (L6b, L6 IT, L6 CT) and Sst Chodl interneurons. These consensus rankings provide experimentally validated targets for pharmacological and genetic manipulation studies.


3.6 Cross-region comparison of receptor expression in shared cell types

To identify conserved versus region-specific receptor expression patterns, we compared BLA and mPFC expression profiles for the 8 interneuron and glial subclasses shared between regions in the MERFISH dataset (which provides spatially confirmed cell identities in both areas) and the 10 shared subclasses in the 10x dataset. Overall cross-region correlation for shared cell types was moderate (MERFISH: fraction expressing ρ=0.587, mean expression ρ=0.570; 10x: ρ=0.728, ρ=0.714), substantially lower than cross-modality correlations within regions, indicating significant region-specific tuning of receptor expression despite shared cell-type identities (Figure 4A–B).

Several receptors showed highly conserved expression patterns across regions, particularly Htr2a (MERFISH cross-region ρ=0.929), Htr3a (ρ=0.714), and Drd1 (ρ=0.762), reflecting cell-type-intrinsic expression programs maintained across brain areas (Supplementary Figure S7). For example, Htr3a expression in Sncg and Vip interneurons was nearly identical between BLA and mPFC (rank agreement heatmap showing minimal rank differences), as was Htr2a expression in Pvalb and Lamp5 populations. These conserved patterns suggest that psychedelic drug effects mediated by Htr2a and neuromodulation via Htr3a likely engage similar interneuron microcircuits across limbic and prefrontal regions.

In contrast, multiple receptors exhibited significant region-specific enrichment (Figure 4C–D, Supplementary Figure S7). In the 10x dataset, Htr2c showed the strongest BLA enrichment (mean log2 fold-change across shared cell types: +1.604, with 9 of 10 cell types higher in BLA), particularly in excitatory neurons and Sncg interneurons. Other BLA-enriched receptors included Htr1d (+1.086), Adra2a (+1.118), Adra2c (+0.925), Htr4 (+0.874), Htr7 (+0.681), and Drd2 (+0.630), with MERFISH data independently confirming Htr7 enrichment (+0.693) and Htr1d enrichment (+0.722). The consistent BLA bias for Htr2c and Adra2a/c across interneuron populations suggests enhanced serotonergic and noradrenergic inhibitory modulation in amygdala circuits, potentially contributing to the amygdala's role in threat detection and anxiety.

Conversely, several receptors showed mPFC enrichment. Adra1b displayed strong mPFC bias in the MERFISH data (log2 FC -1.215, the largest regional difference for any receptor), particularly in Vip interneurons, Sst Chodl, and excitatory neurons. The 10x data similarly showed mPFC enrichment for Adra1a (-0.292) and Adra1b (-0.306). Adrb1 was also mPFC-enriched (+0.354), consistent with the preferential expression in mPFC excitatory neurons noted above. These patterns suggest enhanced α1-adrenergic modulation of disinhibitory circuits and β1-mediated excitation of prefrontal projection neurons, potentially supporting noradrenergic contributions to working memory and cognitive control.

Glia showed generally conserved receptor profiles across regions, with astrocytes displaying minimal regional differences for most receptors and microglia showing low expression overall. This regional invariance in glial receptor expression contrasts with the substantial neuronal heterogeneity and likely reflects core housekeeping functions of neurotransmitter clearance and inflammatory responses that are region-independent.


3.7 Spatially resolved receptor expression within BLA and mPFC substructures

The MERFISH dataset enabled analysis of receptor expression gradients across anatomically defined substructures within each region. In the BLA, we examined expression across anterior (BLAa), posterior (BLAp), and ventral (BLAv) subdivisions for cell type × substructure combinations with ≥30 cells. While most receptors showed relatively uniform expression across BLA subdivisions within each cell type, several patterns emerged (Figure 5). Excitatory LA-BLA-BMA-PA Glut neurons, which were present in sufficient numbers across all three subdivisions, showed modest anterior-posterior gradients for select receptors. Htr2a expression in LA-BLA-BMA-PA neurons was highest in BLAa (mean 0.35, fraction 0.32) with progressive decreases toward BLAp (0.33, 0.30) and BLAv (0.24, 0.25). Drd1 showed a complementary pattern with highest expression in BLAp and BLAv. Interneuron populations were less evenly distributed across subdivisions, with Sst and Pvalb interneurons concentrated in BLAa and BLAp, limiting statistical power for within-region comparisons. The observed gradients were generally subtle relative to cell-type-specific differences, suggesting that cell-type identity is the primary determinant of receptor expression, with anatomical position providing secondary modulation.

Within the mPFC, we analyzed expression across prelimbic (PL), infralimbic (ILA), dorsal anterior cingulate (ACAd), and ventral anterior cingulate (ACAv) areas for cell type × area combinations with ≥30 cells (Figure 6). Excitatory neuron subclasses showed area-specific enrichment patterns reflecting their projection targets and laminar identities. L2/3 IT neurons, which are enriched in superficial layers and include cortico-amygdalar projection populations, showed relatively uniform Htr2a expression across all four areas (PL: 1.47, 0.74; ILA: 1.52, 0.77; ACAd: 1.43, 0.73; ACAv: 1.49, 0.75). L5 ET neurons, which project to brainstem and spinal targets, showed modest variation in Htr7 expression across areas (ACAd: 0.16, 0.17; ACAv: 0.14, 0.15; PL: 0.13, 0.13; ILA: 0.11, 0.12), with highest expression in dorsal anterior cingulate. Deep-layer neurons (L6 CT, L6 IT, L6b) displayed more pronounced area differences for Drd1, with enhanced expression in PL and ACA regions relative to ILA, potentially reflecting area-specific dopaminergic modulation of cortico-thalamic feedback. Interneuron populations showed generally consistent expression across mPFC areas within each subclass, though Vip interneurons showed higher Htr3a expression in ACA regions (ACAd: 2.44, 0.85; ACAv: 2.40, 0.83) relative to PL (2.25, 0.79) and ILA (2.18, 0.77). The preservation of cell-type-specific receptor signatures across mPFC subdivisions suggests that the molecular identity of neuronal subtypes is largely conserved, while quantitative expression differences may contribute to functional specialization of prelimbic, infralimbic, and cingulate circuits in fear expression, extinction, and conflict monitoring, respectively.
